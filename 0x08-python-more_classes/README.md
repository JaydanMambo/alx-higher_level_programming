# 0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects

## Description

In this project, we delve deeper into Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in Python, focusing on classes, objects, attributes, methods, and related topics. The project covers various tasks aimed at solidifying understanding and proficiency in working with classes and objects.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

- General understanding of Python programming and its strengths
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts
- Difference between a class and an object or instance
- Attributes, methods, and their significance in classes
- Usage and implementation of class and instance attributes
- Understanding of `self` and its usage
- Special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, `__repr__`
- Class methods and static methods
- Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
- Properties vs. Getters and Setters
- Dynamically creating arbitrary new attributes for existing instances of a class
- Utilization of `__dict__` for classes and instances
- Pythonic ways of writing getters and setters

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All files must end with a new line
- The first line of all files must be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Code must use the `pycodestyle` (version 2.8.*) coding style
- All files must be executable
- The length of files will be tested using `wc`
- Quiz questions to test knowledge
- No importing of modules

## Tasks

1. **0. Simple rectangle**
    - Write an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
2. **1. Real definition of a rectangle**
    - Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle with private attributes `width` and `height`.
3. **2. Area and Perimeter**
    - Add methods `area` and `perimeter` to the `Rectangle` class.
4. **3. String representation**
    - Add a `__str__` method to the `Rectangle` class for string representation.
5. **4. Eval is magic**
    - Add a `__repr__` method to the `Rectangle` class for string representation with `eval`.
6. **5. Detect instance deletion**
    - Add a message when an instance of `Rectangle` is deleted.
7. **6. How many instances**
    - Add a class attribute to track the number of instances created and deleted.
8. **7. Change representation**
    - Allow changing the symbol used for string representation of `Rectangle`.
9. **8. Compare rectangles**
    - Add a static method to compare rectangles based on their area.
10. **9. A square is a rectangle**
    - Add a class method to create a square `Rectangle`.

## Advanced Task

11. **10. N queens**
    - Solve the N queens puzzle and print every possible solution to the problem.

## Quiz Questions

2. What is the significance of `self` in Python classes?
3. Explain the difference between class attributes and instance attributes.
4. How would you dynamically create new attributes for an existing instance of a class?
5. What does the `__dict__` attribute of a class contain?
6. When is the `__repr__` method used in Python?
7. How do you ensure encapsulation and information hiding in Python classes?
8. Explain the importance of properties versus getters and setters in Python.
