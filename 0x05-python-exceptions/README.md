# 0x05. Python - Exceptions

## Description
This repository contains solutions to tasks related to Python exceptions. Each task involves writing Python functions that demonstrate different aspects of error handling and exception usage.

## Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:
- `0-safe_print_list.py`: Function to safely print elements of a list.
- `1-safe_print_integer.py`: Function to safely print an integer.
- `2-safe_print_list_integers.py`: Function to safely print integers from a list.
- `3-safe_print_division.py`: Function to safely print the result of dividing two integers.
- `4-list_division.py`: Function to divide elements of two lists.
- `5-raise_exception.py`: Function to raise a type exception.
- `6-raise_exception_msg.py`: Function to raise a named exception with a message.
- `100-safe_print_integer_err.py`: Function to safely print an integer with error handling.
- `101-safe_function.py`: Function to execute a function safely.
- `102-magic_calculation.py`: Python function that replicates given bytecode.
- `103-python.c`: C functions to print information about Python objects.

## Requirements
- The code is written in Python 3.8.5.
- All files are executable.
- Code follows PEP8 style guidelines (`pycodestyle` version 2.8.*).
- Files start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- No external modules are used unless explicitly allowed.
- Each task has its own file with a corresponding main file for testing.

## Usage
To run the code for each task, use the provided main files or import the functions and call them with appropriate arguments.
