# 0x06. Python - Classes and Objects

## Description
This repository contains solutions to tasks related to Python classes and objects. Each task involves implementing classes and methods to demonstrate various concepts of object-oriented programming in Python.

## Files
- `0-square.py`: Empty class Square that defines a square.
- `1-square.py`: Class Square that defines a square with a private instance attribute size.
- `2-square.py`: Class Square with size validation.
- `3-square.py`: Class Square with size validation and a public instance method area().
- `4-square.py`: Class Square with size validation, area computation, and access/update to private attribute size.
- `5-square.py`: Class Square with size validation, area computation, and printing the square.
- `6-square.py`: Class Square with size and position validation, area computation, and printing the square with position.
- `100-singly_linked_list.py`: Classes Node and SinglyLinkedList for implementing a singly linked list.
- `101-square.py`: Class Square with size and position validation, area computation, and printing the square with position.
- `102-square.py`: Class Square with size validation and comparators for comparing square areas.
- `103-magic_class.py`: Python class MagicClass that mimics the behavior of a given Python bytecode.

## Background Context
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental concept in programming, and this project aims to deepen your understanding of OOP using Python. It covers topics such as classes, objects, attributes, methods, properties, and more.

## Resources
To understand the concepts and complete the tasks, make sure to read or watch the following resources:

- [Object Oriented Programming](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html)
- [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](https://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php)
- [Learn to Program 9 : Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apACNr7DC_s)
- [Python Classes and Objects](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_classes.asp)

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you are expected to be able to:

- Explain the concept of OOP and its benefits.
- Understand the difference between a class and an object or instance.
- Define classes with attributes and methods.
- Use properties, getters, and setters to control attribute access.
- Implement class methods and static methods.
- Utilize special methods like `__init__`, `__str__`, and others.
- Apply inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation in Python classes.

## Requirements
- Python version 3.8.5 is used for all files.
- All files must end with a new line.
- The first line of all files must be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory for the project.
- Code must adhere to PEP8 style guidelines (`pycodestyle` version 2.8.*).
- All files must be executable.
- Documentation is mandatory for all modules, classes, and functions.

## Usage
To run the code for each task, execute the corresponding main file or import the classes and methods into your Python environment and call them with appropriate arguments.
